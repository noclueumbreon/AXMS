# list of character ideas
- evil mech pilot at the end of the series. eeevil.
	- she's like. me. but evil.
	- well put together. faux hawk. side shave. suit. piercings. scars. buff.
	- fuckin mech named BLOODSKULL. "is a puppy programmed to be good boy" - minns ==*`what did she mean by this?`*==
	- sadistic. she's  sort of a foil to paxe. the two intertwine their lives together after paxe gets captured, her gripping around paxe's mind until it shatters for the sake of her country's offensive on the stars.
	- she uses paxe as a strategic pawn and a tactical nuke on the battlefield. her grip on paxe's mind lets her exploit all of the strengths that having an unkillable mech pilot has without any of the moral questioning that comes with, y'know, actually using a human pilot.
	- after long enough, she's forced into retirement on some burned out shell of a world with bloodskull and paxe. she lives a life of depravity, screwed up sex, etc. kills paxe regularly, usually at the climax of their sex. paxe, for her part, has fragmented into a thousand pieces -- the part of her that's still acting as a front for her body slowly falls into a twisted kinda love with antipaxe.
	- she slips up after a long while, and paxe escapes.
	- the two have a mech fight in burned out, hollow shells of mechs. the mechs break down, and they're forced to fight on foot in a snowed-over forest -- damp with the heat of the battle. antipaxe is terrified, shooting her revolver at any stray sound -- and paxe is like a shadow, silent and slipping in between the stilt-like trees.
	- when they finally come face to face, it's obvious who's going to win.
	- paxe overpowers antipaxe in both endurance and technical skill. they share an intimate moment as she plunges the knife into antipaxe's heart.
