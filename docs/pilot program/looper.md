# looper
worlds most traumatized woman, paxe's first partner, and a fighter til the end

##### glint
> **effect**: after she's killed, she resets to a certain point in time. depending on when in her timestream this reset occurs, she may or may not be able to control where her "start point" is set. she keeps memories, and some glints still affect her for a bit afterwards -- if they're uniquely "sticky".
> **color**: purple
> **reason**: she's twisted up her past hurt and brokenness into the person she is. unfinished business, almost. she wants to keep piloting, piloting, piloting forever, flying in the frame that feels almost like a lover but callous, cold. she can't help but mourn herself, the self she never knew, the self she can never know -- the one they broke down, tortured, and molded into an obedient hound. she desperately wants a do-over. for all of it.

##### story ideas
- so she's fucked up. i know that much. but HOW fucked up?
- i'm glad you asked. so fucked up
- she was busted up in the pilot program, so busted up she basically shattered -- the pieces all fell apart. when she was returned to the ranks of civilians without her memories, she fucking hated it. every second felt like a creeping death. (turns out it was mourning.)
- she's excited to be a *pilot* again. but she realizes quickly that... whatever happened to her, she's not broken. she might have been broken -- early into the loops? -- but she has to throw off her programming and hope in her handler to properly achieve her worth on the battlefield.
- at that point she's over the moon. sure, she'll play the honest mutt, but everyone knows she's *better.* she gets shit *done*. every mission a success, somehow.
- she's basically winning the war single handedly. she goes where she's told, kills who she's asked, and goes back to base with a smile -- no orders needed. fire and forget. sure, she dies a lot -- but nobody knows about that but her, and maybe a few rookies who swear she's shifting about when they see her. the militaries of the two countries haven't yet found a way to utilize glints.
- it's when she's sent on a mission to kill a rogue pilot she first has traitorous thoughts. she's preventing another pilot from being *whole*, in her eyes -- more than just in a war. this is someone who's by all means a non-combatant. someone who didn't fight back. someone who accepted it, with a smile.
- she doesn't know how to process it. in the middle of the night, she steals away.
- deeper into the night, she's attacked by a ship -- from the Other Side, apparently, with capture implements -- and must flee. she darts from star system to star system, until eventually running out of fuel. it's over for her.
- she can't even muster up that peace she saw in the other pilot. she thinks she has more to do. (she just hasn't given up mourning the things she's lost.) she sets her timeloop point, and starts running the simulations.
- this is when she meets paxe.
- story continues, as normal. the two of them dispatch the energy core of the opponent's ship, and keep moving on.
