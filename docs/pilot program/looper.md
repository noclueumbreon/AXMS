# looper
worlds most traumatized woman, paxe's first partner, and a fighter til the end

##### glint
> **effect**: after she's killed, she resets to a certain point in time. depending on when in her timestream this reset occurs, she may or may not be able to control where her "start point" is set. she keeps memories, and some glints still affect her for a bit afterwards -- if they're uniquely "sticky".
> **color**: purple
> **reason**: she's twisted up her past hurt and brokenness into the person she is. unfinished business, almost. she wants to keep piloting, piloting, piloting forever, flying in the frame that feels almost like a lover but callous, cold. she can't help but mourn herself, the self she never knew, the self she can never know -- the one they broke down, tortured, and molded into an obedient hound. she desperately wants a do-over. for all of it.
