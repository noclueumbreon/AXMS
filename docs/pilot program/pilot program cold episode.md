# pilot program cold episode
##### vague idea
> *They have a mission and they gotta do it but like. It’s winter. It’s beautiful and magical and there’s a light dusting of snow. Maybe they’re by a frozen lake and the sun is golden and glinting off the mountainside and the snow covered trees. Brisk chill, not incapacitating but you’d want a coat. And there’s this eerie muffled quality to everything. And, of course, they lay down to feel that little moment you felt in the snow*
> *Maybe they get lost in happy memories*
> *And they chat*
> *They talk about their past*
> *Things they miss, or liked*
> *Precious few happy memories ikik*
> *But*
> *They mention a thing or two*
> *And the mission. It doesn’t take like*
> *A LOT of effort but it’s taking some time*
> *So they talk*
> *And it’s like. Winter but with sci fi elements.*
> *I associate feelings like that with like the Christmas episode of Dr who*
