### core concept
a "disgraced ex-soldier" is sent back home from the front. she experiences pangs of pain until she's driven to sign up for the newly-improved pilot program, and is inducted into their ranks. after she's sent on a suicide mission using a mech she's barely given the time to understand, she discovers she's in a time loop.

- she's not actually a disgraced ex soldier. she's an experimental test pilot for the ApMS program, who was engaged in a repeated series of time loops wherein she grew to love her mech. but it wasn't meant to be. the point of the program was to use up a defective frame on testing what the limits of pilot induction are, burning up a pilot in the process and giving them their money's worth for this worthless hunk of junk.
- she fails to save her mech, and she's wiped of her memories and discharged.
- but she still keeps the hole in her heart, the pain and trauma from living for so long in that state of repeated mind breaking and wiping. the desire to go back to piloting a mech is from that hole her mech left her.
- once she gets in her new mech, she hears a voice -- a different one than before, but a voice nonetheless -- greeting her and welcoming her to her ApMS. this is an alter. the new ApMSes don't have AI in them that interfaces with the pilot.
