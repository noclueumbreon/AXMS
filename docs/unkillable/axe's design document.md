###### AXE, pre-revolution/early-unkillable iteration
- Squared off, bulky.
- Armor plates cover critical areas and joints.
- Fins on back which allow for high-speed maneuvering without the thruster systems of later ApMS models.
- Basic thrusters on back fins.
- Sensor suite is large and inefficient. Non-visual spectrum sensors are covered during combat, unless explicitly opened. Allows for long-range combat, as well as BVR missile launches when equipped with a missile launcher.
- Head is the main sensor suite holder. Neck joint is armored with both armor plates as well as all the wires for the sensor suite.
- Circular protrusion on left breast is an extended armor compartment for the power core of the mech. Power core can be ejected if necessary.
- Pilot gets in via the hatch above the "AXMS" plate.
- Enough space in the head for a repair bay.
- [ ] Bomb vest collar to protect neck joints.
- [ ] Make more obviously "handmade"/"custom made". This is an experimental variation of AXE, after all.
